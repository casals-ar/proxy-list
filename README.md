# 🚀 proxy.casals.ar 🚀

Project with the purpose of validating an HTTP / HTTPS proxy list. 

# ❓ FAQ  ❓

### Q: Where do you get the proxies from?

A: Proxies are obtained from different sources, almost all from open source GitHub repositories or other projects that offer their services for free.

### Q: How works?

A: The validation process involves establishing a connection to the IP address http://1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare) through the proxy. If the connection is successful, the proxy is included in the list and subsequently committed.

### Q: How often is there a commit?

A: 5 minutes. If there are no commits, it is because no valid proxies were found.

### Q: Are proxies removed?

A: Yes, proxies are removed every 24 hours and the verification process starts from scratch.
